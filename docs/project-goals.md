# Project Goals & Vision

## Goals (This Quarter)
- **Configurable Quoting**: A simple yet powerful quoting solution.
- **AI Integration**: Solutions to generate quotes faster.
- **Integration**: Seamless integration with CRM and PSA systems.

## Problem Statement
Organizations that deliver professional services struggle with rigid and fragmented quoting tools that fail to reflect how work is actually sold and delivered. Each customer expects quotes to be structured differently — whether as products, services, roles, milestones, or work breakdown structures — yet most existing solutions force teams into fixed templates that do not align with customer terminology, pricing models, or approval workflows.

Service providers need the ability to:
- Maintain customer-specific catalogs that flexibly represent services, products, add-ons, and expenses.
- Support diverse pricing models such as hourly, weekly, monthly, milestone-based, or flat fees.
- Build quotes that range from simple line-item lists to complex, multi-level WBS structures with roles, effort, and timelines.
- Accurately calculate margins, apply discounts, and control profitability at quote time.
- Share quotes externally and manage customer review and approval in a secure, auditable manner.

Without a flexible quoting foundation, teams rely on spreadsheets and manual processes, leading to inconsistent pricing, poor margin visibility, slower deal cycles, and limited scalability into downstream delivery, billing, and project execution systems.

## Opportunity / Vision
There is a need for a **flexible, customer-aware quoting platform** that adapts to how each business and customer defines work — not the other way around. By designing quoting as a configurable, structured system rather than a static document, organizations can establish a scalable foundation that naturally evolves into a full PSA solution, enabling seamless transition from quote → project → delivery → billing.
